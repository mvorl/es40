 *
 * X-1.12       Camiel Vanderhoeven                             12-JUN-2008
 *      Support for last written and last read memory locations.
 *
 * X-1.10       Camiel Vanderhoeven                             14-MAR-2008
 *      Formatting.
 *
 * X-1.9        Camiel Vanderhoeven                             14-MAR-2008
 *   1. More meaningful exceptions replace throwing (int) 1.
 *   2. U64 macro replaces X64 macro.
 *
 * X-1.8        Camiel Vanderhoeven                             05-MAR-2008
 *      Multi-threading version.
 *
 * X-1.7        Camiel Vanderhoeven                             25-JAN-2008
 *      Trap on unalogned memory access. The previous implementation where
 *      unaligned accesses were silently allowed could go wrong when page
 *      boundaries are crossed.
 *
 * X-1.6        Camiel Vanderhoeven                             18-JAN-2008
 *      Replaced sext_64 inlines with sext_u64_<bits> inlines for
 *      performance reasons (thanks to David Hittner for spotting this!);
 *
 * X-1.5        Camiel Vanderhoeven                             2-DEC-2007
 *      Changed the way translation buffers work. 
 *
 * X-1.4        Camiel Vanderhoeven                             11-APR-2007
 *      Moved all data that should be saved to a state file to a structure
 *      "state".
 *
 * X-1.3        Camiel Vanderhoeven                             30-MAR-2007
 *      Added old changelog comments.
 *
 * X-1.2        Camiel Vanderhoeven                             8-MAR-2007
 *      LDL and LDQ where the destination is R31 do not cause exceptions.
 *
 * X-1.1        Camiel Vanderhoeven                             18-FEB-2007
 *      File created. Contains code previously found in AlphaCPU.h
