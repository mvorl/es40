  * X-1.15       Camiel Vanderhoeven                             14-MAR-2008
  *   1. More meaningful exceptions replace throwing (int) 1.
  *   2. U64 macro replaces X64 macro.
  *
  * X-1.14       Camiel Vanderhoeven                             05-MAR-2008
  *      Multi-threading version.
  *
  * X-1.13       Camiel Vanderhoeven                             30-JAN-2008
  *      Always use set_pc or add_pc to change the program counter.
  *
  * X-1.12       Camiel Vanderhoeven                             30-JAN-2008
  *      Remember number of instructions left in current memory page, so
  *      that the translation-buffer doens't need to be consulted on every
  *      instruction fetch when the Icache is disabled.
  *
  * X-1.11       Camiel Vanderhoeven                             25-JAN-2008
  *      Trap on unalogned memory access. The previous implementation where
  *      unaligned accesses were silently allowed could go wrong when page
  *      boundaries are crossed.
  *
  * X-1.10       Camiel Vanderhoeven                             18-JAN-2008
  *      Replaced sext_64 inlines with sext_u64_<bits> inlines for
  *      performance reasons (thanks to David Hittner for spotting this!);
  *
  * X-1.9        Camiel Vanderhoeven                             2-DEC-2007
  *      Changed the way translation buffers work, the way interrupts work.
  *
  * X-1.8        Camiel Vanderhoeven                             12-NOV-2007
  *      Fix Software Interrupt behaviour.
  *
  * X-1.7        Camiel Vanderhoeven                             30-OCT-2007
  *      IPR 0x2d identified as M_FIX (Mbox fixed behaviour)
  *
  * X-1.6        Camiel Vanderhoeven                             11-APR-2007
  *      Moved all data that should be saved to a state file to a structure
  *      "state".
  *
  * X-1.5        Camiel Vanderhoeven                             30-MAR-2007
  *      Added old changelog comments.
  *
  * X-1.4        Camiel Vanderhoeven                             8-MAR-2007
  *      Different argument list for CTranslationBuffer methods, and for
  *      va_form function.
  *
  * X-1.3        Camiel Vanderhoeven                             3-MAR-2007
  *      Put 0x2d in HW_MTPR to get rid of error messages about this unknown
  *      IPR. WE STILL NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT THIS REGISTER DOES.
  *
  * X-1.2        Camiel Vanderhoeven                             22-FEB-2007
  *      Got rid of calls to get_asn.
  *
  * X-1.1        Camiel Vanderhoeven                             18-FEB-2007
  *      File created. Contains code previously found in AlphaCPU.h
