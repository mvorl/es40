  *
  * X-1.52       David Hittner                                   16-JAN-2008

  *	CSystem::LoadROM() puts a special opcode (a CALL_PAL instruction
  *	with an otherwise illegal operand of 0x01234xx) in memory.

  *   a)	Possibility to disable SRM-code replacements with the defines
  *	SRM_NO_IDE, SRM_NO_SRL, and SRM_NO_SPEEDUPS
  *   b) Possibility to send SRM-code replacement debugging messages to the
  *	console, with the defines DEBUG_SRM_IDE and DEBUG_SRM_SRL

  *	the processot to go to the interrupt PAL vector (680)
  *

  *
  * X-1.23	Camiel Vanderhoeven				7-MAR-2007
  *	HACK to stop APB.EXE from crashing when passing bootflags
  *
  * X-1.22	Camiel Vanderhoeven				3-MAR-2007
  *	Wrote code to be executed in stead of SRM console code for writing
  *	to the serial port, and reading from IDE disks. Mechanism is based
  *	on recognition of the PC value. Should be replaced with a better
  *	mechanism in the future.
  *
  * X-1.21	Camiel Vanderhoeven				2-MAR-2007
  *	Initialize debug_string to "".
  *
  * X-1.20	Camiel Vanderhoeven				2-MAR-2007
  *	Fixed problem in Save and RestoreState; argument f conflicted with

  *	after the literal; changed this to only before).
  *
  * X-1.14	Camiel Vanderhoeven				18-FEB-2007
  *	Put all actual code behind the processor opcodes in cpu_xxx.h include
  *	files, and replaced them with OP(...,...) macro's in this file.
  *
  * X-1.13       Camiel Vanderhoeven                             16-FEB-2007
  *   a) Added CAlphaCPU::listing.
  *   b) Clocking changes (due to changes in CSystem): CAlphaCPU::DoClock now
  *      returns a value, and the CPU is registered as a fast clocked device.
  *

  *      previously
  *

/**
 * idle_nap: sleep the cpu thread while the guest idles.  
 * HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL
 * Should be mostly-safe on Linux, but still can oversleep in various edge cases.
 * Cchip timer is only checked before entering JIT loop, same with interpreter. 
 * so 'never sleeps past next_timer_fire' below is not guaranteed on any platform.
 * Various other guest-configurable aspects can also change these timelines
 * IPIs could be delayed in response from CPU0. This may or may not trigger
 * guest timeouts
 * FreeBSD is probably the safest host platform this code can run on. 
 * CPU0 DOES NOT IMMEDIATELY SERIVCE THE TIMER AFTER THE NAP
 *
 * Intended operation of this function: 
 * Wakes on pending interrupt/timer, StopThread, or reset (100us poll, 1ms cap); 
 * CPU0 never sleeps past next_timer_fire, since its own loop fires the interval
 * tick.  No-op unless idle_nap = true in the cpu config, and on MP configs
 * (no cross-thread IPI wakeup here -- WTINT just returns immediately).

/**
 * \brief Translate a virtual address to a physical address.
 *
 * Translate a 64-bit virtual address into a 64-bit physical address, using
 * the page table buffers.
 *
 * The following steps are taken to resolve the address:
 *  - See if the address can be found in the translation buffer.
 *  - If not, try to load the right page table entry into the translation
 *    buffer, if this is not possible, trap to the OS.
 *  - Check access privileges.
 *  - Check fault bits.
 *  .
 *
 * \param virt    Virtual address to be translated.
 * \param phys    Pointer to where the physical address is to be returned.
 * \param flags   Set of flags that determine the exact functioning of the
 *                function. A combination of the following flags:
 *                  - ACCESS_READ   Data-read-access.
 *                  - ACCESS_WRITE  Data-write-access.
 *                  - ACCESS_EXEC   Code-read-access.
 *                  - NO_CHECK      Do not perform access checks.
 *                  - VPTE          VPTE access; if this misses, it's a double miss.
 *                  - FAKE          Access is not initiated by executing code, but by
 *                                  the debugger. If a translation can't be found
 *                                  through the translation buffer, don't bother.
 *                  - ALT           Use alt_cm for access checks instead of cm.
 *                  - RECUR         Recursive try. We tried to find this address
 *                                  before, added a TB entry, and now it should sail
 *                                  through.
 *                  - PROBE         Access is for a PROBER or PROBEW access; Don't
 *                                  swap in the page if it is outswapped.
 *                  - PROBEW        Access is for a PROBEW access.
 *                  .
 * \param asm_bit Status of the ASM (address space match) bit in the page-table-entry.
 * \param ins     Instruction currently being executed. Important for the correct
