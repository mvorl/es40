 /**
  * \file
  * This file is simply a list of SDL key symbols taken from <SDL/SDL_keysym.h>.
  * The order in this file is not important.  In sdl.cc, DEF_SDL_KEY() is
  * defined as a macro and then it includes this file to fill in all the data in
  * its key mapping table.
  *
  * The symbols, such as SDLK_RETURN, are used for two purposes.  They
  * are converted into a string (by the # operator in processor), which is
  * compared to the host key name in the keymap file.  Also, the value of
  * the symbol is inserted into the key mapping table.  Then the value is
  * compared with the keysym field of each key up/down event as it arrives.
  *
  * If you get undefined symbol errors in this file, it must mean that
  * your SDL library version doesn't define those same SDLK_* symbols in
  * <SDL/SDL_keysym.h>.  You can't fix it with #ifdef SDLK_SYM because
  * they are enums, so you'll just have to comment out the offending line.
  * The list was generated using symbols from SDL 1.2.3.
