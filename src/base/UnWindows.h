//
// Library: Foundation
// Package: Core
// Module:  UnWindows
//
// A wrapper around the "Poco/UnWindows.h" header file that #undef's some
// of the macros for function names defined by "Poco/UnWindows.h" that
// are a frequent source of conflicts (e.g., GetUserName).
//
// Remember, that most of the WIN32 API functions come in two variants,
// an Unicode variant (e.g., GetUserNameA) and an ASCII variant (GetUserNameW).
// There is also a macro (GetUserName) that's either defined to be the Unicode
// name or the ASCII name, depending on whether the UNICODE macro is #define'd
// or not. POCO always calls the Unicode or ASCII functions directly (depending
// on whether POCO_WIN32_UTF8 is #define'd or not), so the macros are not ignored.
//
// These macro definitions are a frequent case of problems and naming conflicts,
// especially for C++ programmers. Say, you define a class with a member function named
// GetUserName. Depending on whether "Poco/UnWindows.h" has been included by a particular
// translation unit or not, this might be changed to GetUserNameA/GetUserNameW, or not.
// While, due to naming conventions used, this is less of a problem in POCO, some
// of the users of POCO might use a different naming convention where this can become
// a problem.
//
// To disable the #undef's, compile POCO with the POCO_NO_UNWINDOWS macro #define'd.
