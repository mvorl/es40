\section c019 version 0.18 -> 0.18+

 - New BREAKPOINT READ, WRITE and ACCESS commands in the debugger allow breakpoint to be set
   on data access. (12-jun-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Support for SRM/DPR mechanism for starting secondary CPUs. Not working correctly, although
   we seem to be on to something. (12-jun-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Fixed unaligned memory access handling.  (12-jun-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Fixed compilation on Fedora 9 / gcc 4.3.0, and probably other configurations as well.
   (12-jun-2008, Caolan McNamara)
 - Removed dependency on Poco by including parts of it. (31-may-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Fixed a bug in the SDL configuration script (checking for "true" rather than "yes" in the
   final test). (09-may-2008, Caolán McNamarra)
 - Floppy controller implementation. (29-apr-2008, Brian Wheeler)
 - CDiskController is no longer a CPCIDevice. This alows for non-PCI diskcontrollers (like the
   floppy controller. (29-apr-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Added memory map dumping and memory range checking. (29-apr-2008, Brian Wheeler)
 - Rewrote DMA code to make it ready for floppy support. (18-apr-2008, Brian Wheeler)
 - More questions in debug confuration script. (03-apr-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Improved support for SDL on OS-X. (10-apr-2008, Martin Borgman)
 - Compile on OpenVMS; new OpenVMS build scripts generated from the UNIX build scripts; Include
   selected parts of Poco (Poco has dropped support for OpenVMS). (02-apr-2008, Camiel
   Vanderhoeven)
 - Created configuration file utility. (28-mar-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Support OpenVMS file paths. (26-mar-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Use the config.h data created by the configure script. (26-mar-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Improved IDE locking by a) Removing all of the general register locking; b) Busmaster locking
   is still in place, but it might not be needed, this locking is pretty fine grained so nothing
   should time out waiting for it; c) Creating an alt_status variable which gets updated when the
   real status becomes stable (i.e. at the end of the execute() run, after the drq status is
   changed, etc), access to this variable is locked; d) Everything else is a free for all.
   (20-mar-2008, Brian Wheeler)
 - Implement an optional delayed IDE interrupt. The OSes still lose interrupts sometimes. 
   (20-mar-2008, Brian Wheeler)

 - Support disk image files >2GB on linux. (19-mar-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Fixed some IDE CD-ROM issues that were introduced with the multi-threading patch. (17-mar-2008,
   Brian Wheeler)
 - Restored SDL functionality. (16-mar-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Better exception handling, restored Serial port menu functionality (14-mar-2008, Camiel
   Vanderhoeven)
 - Ability to stop and restart threads, restored save/restore state functionality. (13-mar-2008, 
   Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Use separate threads for devices rather than crowding everything into one thread. Use Poco 
   libraries for platform independent threading. NOTE: This patch breaks some functionality that 
   we will need to regain in the future. (05-mar-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)

 - Fix vms boot problems from ide cdrom and make Tru64 installation possible by: a) Clearing the 
   busmaster active bit when the bit 1 is written to the busmaster status register; and b) 
   Attempting to refire the interrupt if the driver seems to have missed it. (27-feb-2008, Brian 
   Wheeler)

 - Disable unaligned access check alltogether; it doesn't work properly for some reason. 
   (05-feb-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - The new floating point code (21-jan-2008) has some unidentified problems. The OpenVMS 
   installation routine fails with this new code. For now, the old floating point code has been 
   restored, and the new floating-point code is used only when HAVE_NEW_FP has been defined. The
   new code should be fixed, so we can take advantage of floating point exceptions. (05-feb-2008,
   Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Display a message when system initialization has failed. (05-feb-2008, Brian Wheeler)
 - Put X64 around 64-bit constants in DO_CVTQL. (compilation issue on some Linux'es) (05-feb-2008,
   Camiel Vanderhoeven)

   procgone bugcheck. (04-feb-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Completed LPT support so it works with FreeBSD as a guest OS. (02-feb-2008, Brian Wheeler)
 - Avoid unnecessary shift-operations to calculate constant values. (01-feb-2008, Camiel
   Vanderhoeven)
 - Improved speed by remembering the number of instructions left in current memory page, so that 
   the translation-buffer doens't need to be consulted on every instruction fetch when the Icache
   is disabled. (30-jan-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Remember separate last found translation-buffer entries for read and write operations. This 
   should help with memory copy operations. (29-jan-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Avoid interrupts from the new IDE device that originated while interrupts were disabled. 
   (29-jan-2008, Brian Wheeler)
 - Improved floating-point exception handling. (28-jan-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)

   (26-jan-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Don't repeat interrupts from the new IDE controller too soon. (26-jan-2008, Brian Wheeler)
 - Do unaligned trap only when a page boundary is crossed. Something is causing alignment traps in
   the SRM console, with the DAT bit set to false, and no OS handler in place. Also, when OpenVMS
   boots there are alignment traps that shouldn't happen. None of these cross page boundaries, so
   we're safe for now. (26-jan-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Trap on unaligned memory access. The previous implementation where unaligned accesses were
   silently allowed could go wrong when page boundaries are crossed. (25-jan-2008, Camiel 
   Vanderhoeven)
 - Allow specifying autocreate_size on a disk image to have it created if it doesn't exist. 
   (25-jan-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Added an option to disable the processor Icache. The emulator runs faster when this is
   disabled, but that might lead to problems with some OS'es. (25-jan-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Added do_pci_write and do_pci_read functions to the PCI base device. (24-jan-2008, Camiel
   Vanderhoeven, David Hittner)
 - Fixed overflow-detection. (24-jan-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Added missing integer /V instructions (22-jan-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven, Bob Supnik)
 - win32 GUI made compatible with older windows SDK. (22-jan-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - New floating-point code (21-jan-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven, Bob Supnik)
 - Fixed misinterpretation of the INT bit in integer overflow traps. (21-jan-2008, Camiel
   Vanderhoeven)

   (Camiel Vanderhoeven, 21-jan-2008)
 - Added X11 GUI. (20-jan-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Added win32 GUI. (19-jan-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)

   and has several problems. (19-jan-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Replaced sext_64 inlines for performance reasons (18-jan-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven, David
   Hittner)
 - Process device interrupts after a 100-cpu-cycle delay. (18-jan-2008, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Added ADDL/V instruction (16-jan-2008, David Hittner, Bob Supnik)
 - Fixed some timeouts on new IDE controller. (16-jan-2008, Brian Wheeler)
 - When a keyboard self-test command is received, and the queue is not empty, the queue is cleared
   so the 0x55 that's sent back will be the first thing in line. Makes the keyboard initialize a
   little better with SRM. (15-jan-2008, Brian Wheeler)

   Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 .

\section c015 version 0.14 -> 0.15

   cache line), memcpy is used to move memory into the ICACHE. CAVEAT: ICACHE can only be filled
   from memory (not from I/O). (06-nov-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Added integer /V instructions (without actual overflow detection support). (02-nov-2007, Camiel
   Vanderhoeven)
 - Added missing floating point instructions. (02-nov-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Remember the last found translation buffer entry to improve speed. (02-nov-2007, Camiel
   Vanderhoeven)
 .

\section c014 version 0.13 -> 0.14

First boot version. This version is capable of booting OpenVMS 7.3-1 in conversational bootstrap
mode.

 - Fixed address translation sign extension. (31-oct-2007, Eduardo Marcelo Serrat)
 - Disable memory access checks for now. (31-oct-2007, Eduardo Marcelo Serrat)
 - Fixed floating point conversion routines. (31-oct-2007, Eduardo Marcelo Serrat)
 - Added CVTDG, CVTGD, CVTGF, MULG instructions. (31-oct-2007, Eduardo Marcelo Serrat)
 - EXC_SUM contained the wrong register (3 in stead of 1) on a DTBM exception. (31-oct-2007,
   Eduardo Marcelo Serrat)
 - Disable SRM replacement routines. (31-oct-2007, Eduardo Marcelo Serrat)
 - Corrected IDE interface revision level. (31-oct-2007, Eduardo Marcelo Serrat)
 - IPR 0x2d identified as M_FIX (Mbox fixed behaviour). (30-oct-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - On a big-endian system, the LBA address for a read or write action was byte-swapped. Fixed
   this. (18-apr-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Faster lockstep mechanism (send info 50 cpu cycles at a time). (18-apr-2007, Camiel
   Vanderhoeven)
 - Decompressed ROM image is now identical between big- and small-endian platforms (put endian_64
   around PALbase and PC). (18-apr-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Give ASM bit a value (true) for PALmode Icache entries. (17-apr-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Allow a telnet client program to be in a directory containing spaces on Windows 
   ("c:\program files\putty\putty.exe"). (17-apr-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - PCI reset support added. (16-apr-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Remove old address range if a new one is registered (same device/same index). (16-apr-2007,
   Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Allow configuration strings with spaces in them. (16-apr-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Never start a telnet client when running as lockstep slave, because we want to receive a
   connection from the master instead. (16-apr-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Added possibility to start a Telnet client automatically. (16-apr-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 .

\section c013 version 0.12 -> 0.13


 - Save more information in state file (11-apr-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Fixed bug in TRC_DEV in SRM_READ_IDE_DISK (11-apr-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Explicitly convert integers to double for calls to log/pow in floating-point conversion
   routines. (11-apr-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Replaced CSystem::LoadROM and CSystem::SelectROM() calls with a single CSystem::LoadROM call.
   (10-apr-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Removed obsolete ROM-handling code. (10-apr-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Extended ROM-handling code to favor loading decompressed ROM code over loading compressed code,
   and to save decompressed ROM code during the first time the emulator is run. (10-apr-2007, 
   Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - New mechanism for SRM replacements. Where these need to be executed, CSystem::LoadROM puts a 
   special opcode (a CALL_PAL instruction with an otherwise illegal operand of 0x01234xx) in
   memory. CAlphaCPU::DoClock recognizes these opcodes and performs the SRM action. Fixed address
   translation sign extension. (10-apr-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Added PCB to job context recognition in IDB tracing. (07-apr-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Fixed CAlphaCPU::get_prbr. The virtual address was returned instead of the physical one! 
   (05-apr-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Fixed wrong IDE configuration mask (address ranges masked were too short, leading to 
   overlapping memory regions). (05-apr-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Reduced number of page-table entries back to 128. (01-apr-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - InvalidateSingle invalidates all matching translation buffer entries, if more than one match.
   (01-apr-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Define NO_INTELLIGENT_TB by default, because some bug causes the translation buffer to return
   bogus translations for IDE addresses to the DQDRIVER. (31-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 .

\section c012 version 0.11 -> 0.12

 - Added AST to the list of conditions that cause the processor to go to the interrupt PAL vector
   (680). (29-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - When DEBUG_PIC is defined, generate more debugging messages. (27-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - When an interrupt originates from the cascaded interrupt controller, the interrupt vector from
   the cascaded controller is returned. (27-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 -	When interrupts are ended on the cascaded controller, and no interrupts are left on that
    controller, the cascade interrupt (2) on the primary controller is ended as well. I'M NOT 
    COMPLETELY SURE IF THIS IS CORRECT, but what goes on in OpenVMS seems to imply this. 
    (27-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - When the system state is saved to a vms file, and then restored, the ide_status may be 0xb9,
   this bug has not been found yet, but as a workaround, we detect the value 0xb9, and replace it
   with 0x40. (27-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Changed the values for cylinders/heads/sectors on the IDE identify command, because it looks
   like OpenVMS' DQDRIVER doesn't like it if the number of sectors is greater than 63. 
   (27-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - All IDE commands generate an interrupt upon completion. (27-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - IDE command SET TRANSLATION (0x91) is recognized, but has no effect. This is allright, as long
   as OpenVMS NEVER DOES CHS-mode access to	the disk. (27-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Add possibility to disable "smart" Translation Buffers by defining NO_INTELLIGENT_TB.
   (27-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Specific-EOI's (end-of-interrupt) now only end the interrupt they are meant for. (26-mar-2007,
   Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - When DEBUG_PIC is defined, debugging messages for the interrupt controllers are output to the
   console, same with DEBUG_IDE and the IDE controller. (26-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - If IDE registers for a non-existing drive are read, 0xff is returned. (26-mar-2007, Camiel
   Vanderhoeven)
 - Generate an interrupt when a sector is read or written from a disk. (26-mar-2007, Camiel
   Vanderhoeven)
 - Possibility to disable SRM-code replacements with the defines SRM_NO_IDE, SRM_NO_SRL, and
   SRM_NO_SPEEDUPS. (26-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Possibility to send SRM-code replacement debugging messages to the console, with the defines
   DEBUG_SRM_IDE and DEBUG_SRM_SRL. (26-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Added software-interrupts to the list of conditions that can cause the processor to go to the
   interrupt PAL vector (680). (26-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Show references to unknown memory regions when DEBUG_UNKMEM is defined. (26-mar-2007, Camiel
   Vanderhoeven)
 .

\section c011 version 0.09 -> 0.11

   (18-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Removed pointles comparison (v_prbr > 0). (18-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Debugger translation from virtual to physical address moved to an inline function (code to do
   this was duplicated many times...). (14-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Do not perform address translations when we are listing. (14-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Added CTraceEngine::list_all method. (14-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)

 - When an exception occurs, debugging information for the previous instruction is no longer lost.
   (12-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Made various printf-statements 64-bit safe in a neater way. (Use printf("%" LL "x",value)
   instead of printf("%x",(u64)value)). (12-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Added support for "smart" Translation Buffers. (12-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Set values for EXC_SUM and MM_STAT on various exceptions. (12-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)

   Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - endian.h renamed to es40_endian.h. (08-mar-2007, Brian Wheeler)
 - When tracing, try to convert virtual addresses to physical ones	through the translation
   buffers. (08-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - CAlphaCPU::va_form now takes a boolean argument bIBOX to determine which ASN and VPTB to use.
   (08-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - LDL and LDQ where the destination is R31 do not cause exceptions. (08-mar-2007, Camiel
   Vanderhoeven)
 - When doing a double translationbuffer lookup, do it manually. (08-mar-2007, Camiel
   Vanderhoeven)
 - When no entry is found, try to look it up in the page table ourselves. (08-mar-2007, Camiel
   Vanderhoeven)
 - Inline translationbuffer functions turned into normal functions, and moved to 
   TranslationBuffer.cpp. (08-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - TranslationBuffer functions get their asn information from CAlphaCPU, rather than getting the
   ASN number as an argument. (08-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 .

\section c009 version 0.08 -> 0.09

   1667018, 1674311, 1676079, 1676081 and 1676093. (07-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - HACK to stop APB.EXE from crashing when passing bootflags. (07-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Added CAlphaCPU::get_tb, CAlphaCPU::get_asn and CAlphaCPU::get_spe functions. (07-mar-2007,
   Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Put 0x2d in HW_MTPR to get rid of error messages about this unknown IPR. WE STILL NEED TO FIND
   OUT WHAT THIS REGISTER DOES. (03-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Wrote code to be executed in stead of SRM console code for writing to the serial port, and
   reading from IDE disks. Mechanism is based on recognition of the PC value. Should be replaced
   with a better mechanism in the future. (03-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Accesses to IDE-configuration space and data buffers are byte-swapped on a big-endian
   architecture. This is done through the endian_xxx macro's. (SPARC-port) (01-mar-2007, Camiel
   Vanderhoeven)
 - All $-signs in variable names are replaced with underscores. (SPARC-port) (01-mar-2007, Camiel

   (01-mar-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 .

\section c008 version 0.07 -> 0.08

 - Lockstep mechanism added. (28-feb-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)

   us to do other things with debugger output. (lockstep-comparison, for instance). (28-feb-2007,
   Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Add support for OpenVMS as a host OS. (27-feb-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - E_FAULT returned from translation buffer now causes DFAULT exception. (22-feb-2007, Camiel

   other devices that need a clock should probably be slow clock devices. (16-feb-2007, Camiel
   Vanderhoeven)
 - DoClock was replaced with CSystem::Run, which runs until one of the connected devices returns
   something other than 0; and CSystem::SingleStep. (16-feb-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)

 - Removed loggin of last_write_loc and last_write_val. (09-feb-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - Disable eating of first characters received on serial ports. Treat Telnet commands properly for
   Linux. (07-feb-2007, Brian Wheeler)
 - Debugging functions are enabled only when compiling with IDB defined (Interactive Debugger, a 
   future feature). (07-feb-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)

 - Made various dubugging-related statements dependent on the definition of IDB (interactive
   debugger). (07-feb-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - RUN_LT can be defined to provide a breakpoint (end if pc < defined value). (03-feb-2007, Camiel
   Vanderhoeven)
 - Restructure Linux/Windows CSerial code mixing to make more sense. (03-feb-2007, Camiel
   Vanderhoeven)
 - Eat first incoming characters on serial ports (so we don't burden the SRM with weird incoming
   characters. (03-feb-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - No longer start PuTTy. We might just want to do something wild like connecting from a different
   machine! (03-feb-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)

   (03-feb-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
 - FindConfig() now returns the default value rather than crashing when none of the standard
   configuration files can be found. (03-feb-2007, Camiel Vanderhoeven)
